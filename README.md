# API-to-S3-to-Snowflake-ETL-Pipeline
This project demonstrates a real-world, production-style ETL pipeline that:  - Extracts data from a public API - Validates it using [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) - Uploads the data to an AWS S3 bucket - Loads the validated data into a Snowflake data warehouse - Orchestrates everything using Apache Airflow
